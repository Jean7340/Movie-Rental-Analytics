# 🎬 Movie Rental Analytics  

Imagine managing a bustling DVD rental store and trying to understand **which movies keep customers coming back**, **who your most loyal customers are**, and **where the business makes the most money**.  

This project explores the [Sakila Movie Rental Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) — a fictional dataset of films, customers, rentals, and payments — and turns it into a **business intelligence story** through **SQL analysis** and **Tableau dashboards**.

## 🔍 Questions We Asked

- Who are the **most valuable customers**, and how much do they contribute to revenue?

## 🔍 What We Found  

In our analysis, one of the most striking findings was that the **top 5%** of customers were responsible for nearly 20% of the company’s total revenue, showing a highly concentrated customer base that significantly influenced business performance. Looking at genres, we discovered that while Family and Animation films were the most frequently rented, it was Action and Drama that generated higher revenue per rental, suggesting that popularity did not always align with profitability.

Time-based patterns also emerged: rentals spiked by **about 35%** on weekends, pointing to clear demand cycles and opportunities for targeted promotions. Finally, geography played an important role. Customers from urban areas rented more than twice as often as those from rural locations, revealing strong market segmentation that could inform future marketing strategies.
